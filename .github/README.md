This addon provides a very simple and customizable way to implement crosshairs in the form of a Control node.

## How to use

- Download the addon and place it in your Godot project
- Add `UltimateCrosshairs.gd` to a Control node in your scene
- Pick one of 3 different styles: `DOT_ONLY`, `STANDARD`, or `SHOTGUN`
- Adjust `spread_pixels` to change the size of the crosshairs
  - Alternatively, call `set_spread_degrees(angle, vertical_fov)` to space the crosshairs according to a given a cone angle.
- Adjust other settings such as colors, outline thickness and number of lines.
